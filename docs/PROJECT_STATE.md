  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: active restore points staged and ready.

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Published current `R4` dataset-driven CGM replay baseline to project remote.
  - branch: `main`
  - commit: `0b11472`
  - push target: `origin/main`
- Result: GitHub now contains the active restore-point firmware/docs state.

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: LIVE replay CGM path now ingests real `subject001` glucose samples instead of synthetic glucose generation during playback.
  - Added generated glucose replay header from holdout dataset:
    - `src/cgm_replay_subject001.h` (`CGM_REPLAY_SUBJECT001_LEN=1438`, sourced from `data/d1namo_test_subject001.csv`)
  - Firmware wiring:
    - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
      - playback loop now feeds each replay step into CGM via `GaugeRender_IngestReplayCgmSample(...)`
      - replay CGM index resets on all playback start/restart paths
      - replay CGM ingest disabled during record/non-playback paths
    - `src/gauge_render.h/.c`
      - added `GaugeRender_IngestReplayCgmSample(...)`
      - bypass synthetic CGM generation while LIVE replay CGM ingest is active
      - UI center label shows `DATA` (instead of `SIM`) for replay-driven CGM
- Scoring alignment:
  - prediction score continues to use due-time interpolation fix from prior update and now evaluates against replay-driven glucose truth during playback.
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ready for 4-day subject001 benchmark run with dataset-driven CGM path.

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed prediction score under fast replay by evaluating each due prediction against an interpolated glucose actual at the prediction due timestamp (instead of scoring all overdue slots against one current glucose sample).
  - `src/gauge_render.c`
    - added due-time actual interpolation helper for prediction scoring
    - `PredEvalConsumeDue(...)` now uses interpolated due-time glucose
    - added rolling previous `(time, glucose)` state to support replay time jumps
- Why:
  - in warmup/full-run fast modes, timeline steps can be larger than scoring issue cadence; this previously biased score low.
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ready for on-device re-check of prediction score progression.

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Removed synthetic startup accuracy by requiring real evaluation evidence before score priming.
  - `src/gauge_render.c`
    - `GaugeRender_PrimePredictionScore()` now requires `gUiPredEvalCount >= 6` before priming
    - if evaluations are insufficient, score remains unprimed at `0%` (no fallback 67% baseline)
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Added explicit score priming at warmup completion so post-preroll score does not remain at 0 due to priming lag.
  - `src/gauge_render.h/.c`
    - added `GaugeRender_PrimePredictionScore()` to force score primed state from current MAE blend
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - call prime hook on both warmup completion paths:
      - normal completion (`AI_WARMUP: complete ...`)
      - forced completion (`AI_WARMUP: force_complete ...`)
- Effect:
  - score is initialized immediately after warmup handoff instead of waiting for additional real-time priming cycles
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Extended fast warmup window to include additional scoring runway before LIVE realtime handoff.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - replaced single warmup target with phased durations:
      - preseed: `RECPLAY_WARMUP_PRESEED_DS = 2h`
      - score: `RECPLAY_WARMUP_SCORE_DS = 2h`
      - total fast window: `RECPLAY_WARMUP_TARGET_DS = 4h`
    - startup log now prints both phase durations
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed lingering `THINKING` after warmup by making warning-overlay thinking gate warmup-flag only.
  - `src/gauge_render.c`
    - `THINKING` display condition changed from:
      - `ai_enabled && (gUiWarmupThinking || !gUiPredMaePrimed)`
      - to `ai_enabled && gUiWarmupThinking`
  - effect: once warmup clears (normal or forced), warning box will not remain in `THINKING` due to MAE priming lag.
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Eliminated persistent `THINKING` latch after warmup by making warning-box `THINKING` state warmup-only.
  - `src/gauge_render.c`
    - `DrawAiAlertOverlay(...)` now enters `THINKING` only when explicit warmup flag is true (`gUiWarmupThinking`)
    - removed additional `!gUiPredMaePrimed` condition from warning overlay gating
- Effect:
  - after warmup clear (or force-complete), warning box exits `THINKING` even if prediction MAE priming is still catching up
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed stuck `THINKING` state after 2h by adding a display-timeline fail-safe unlatch for warmup completion.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - in runtime-clock update loop, if warmup is still active but `runtime_displayed_ds >= RECPLAY_WARMUP_TARGET_DS`:
      - force warmup complete
      - clear `THINKING`
      - reset playback cadence state
      - emit `AI_WARMUP: force_complete ...`
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed apparent freeze after LIVE warmup by interpolating runtime clock continuously between real-time replay samples.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - added replay realtime anchor state:
      - `playback_rt_anchor_ds`
      - `playback_rt_anchor_ticks`
    - when LIVE + post-warmup replay is active, runtime clock now advances from anchor using elapsed wall time until next replay sample arrives
    - anchor updates on each replay sample; anchor-based interpolation coexists with timestamp-delta sample cadence
- Effect:
  - timeline no longer appears stuck at sample boundaries (e.g. `02:15:00`) while running true real-time playback with sparse (5-minute) samples
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: After LIVE warmup completes, replay now switches to real-time playback cadence driven by replay timestamp deltas.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - added playback cadence state (`playback_period_us`, `playback_prev_ts_ds`, `playback_prev_ts_valid`)
    - when `LIVE` and warmup is complete, recplay period is taken from `ts_ds` delta between consecutive replay samples (`ds * 100000us`)
    - clamps real-time period range to `0.1s .. 600s`
    - resets cadence state on mode changes, restart/retry, and loop boundary to avoid stale timing
  - effect:
    - warmup still fast-forwards
    - post-warmup playback follows dataset timing instead of fixed log-rate stepping
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Decoupled LIVE sensor visualization channels from replay payload so ball/activity/IMU visuals are no longer driven by preloaded test replay samples.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - restored live sensor updates during playback by removing `!playback_active` gate in accel/gyro update loop
    - playback branch now treats ext-flash samples as timeline/playhead input only (no direct overwrite of accel/gyro/mag/baro/temp render channels)
  - intent:
    - keep long replay timeline behavior for CGM/timing demo
    - keep movement/activity visuals tied to real board sensors instead of synthetic replay-mapped values
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Added boot-time preload of full default replay dataset into ext flash to test 4+ day playback timeline capacity.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - added `PreloadDefaultReplayToExtFlash(...)`:
      - clears ext flash sample ring
      - writes all `REPLAY_TRACE_DEFAULT_LEN` samples from `kReplayTrace_Default`
      - assigns timeline spacing `REPLAY_DEFAULT_STEP_DS=3000` (5-minute intervals)
    - startup now runs preload when ext flash is ready, then rewrites UI settings metadata so saved UI config remains valid
  - expected replay timeline span from preloaded trace:
    - `(REPLAY_TRACE_DEFAULT_LEN - 1) * 3000 ds` (about 4.99 days with current 1438 samples)
  - UART markers added:
    - `EXT_FLASH_PRELOAD: start ...`
    - `EXT_FLASH_PRELOAD: done ...`
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed LIVE replay timeline freeze around `07:47` by hardening runtime clock progression and playback restart behavior.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - playback timestamp clamp now advances by `+1 ds` on non-monotonic sample times instead of pinning to a fixed value
    - added LIVE-mode auto-retry restart path when playback becomes inactive (`EXT_FLASH_PLAY: retry_restart`)
  - intent: prevent timeline lock at a fixed time when replay timestamps repeat or when restart fails once at trace boundary
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Added startup fast-warmup flow for LIVE replay so UI stays in `THINKING` until 2 hours of replay timeline are preseeded, then automatically switches to realtime replay speed.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - added warmup constants:
      - `RECPLAY_WARMUP_MULTIPLIER=120`
      - `RECPLAY_WARMUP_TARGET_DS=72000` (2h)
    - added warmup state machine (`ConfigurePlaybackWarmup(...)`) and applied it to all playback start/restart paths
    - during playback, consumes accelerated replay steps during warmup and auto-handoffs to realtime once target timeline reached
    - emits UART markers:
      - `AI_WARMUP: start ...`
      - `AI_WARMUP: complete ... switching to realtime`
  - `src/gauge_render.c/.h`
    - added `GaugeRender_SetWarmupThinking(bool)` so warning box `THINKING` can be explicitly held during warmup phase
    - `THINKING` now stays active while warmup flag is set (or prediction scoring is unprimed)
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Persisted AI backend selection (`AI MCU` / `AI NPU`) across reboot so settings no longer reset to NPU on boot.
  - updated UI settings metadata schema in `src/ext_flash_recorder.c/.h` to store backend selection with backward-compatible decode
  - wired backend field through save/load APIs and app startup restore in `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
  - updated settings save callsites to include `ai_use_npu`
  - startup log now prints backend in `UI_CFG_LOAD` line

    - suppress predictive alert evaluation when `CGM_FLAG_IMPLAUSIBLE_ROC` is active
    - require trend-direction and minimum trend magnitude for hypo/hyper warning/fault entry
    - add current-glucose sanity bands for alert entry (warn/fault) to avoid unrealistic trips from transient trend spikes

  - added preprocessing module:
    - `src/cgm_preprocess.h`
    - `src/cgm_preprocess.c`
  - preprocessing stages implemented:
    - ADC-domain conversion with offset/gain and quadratic linearization
    - reference-voltage compensation
    - anti-alias low-pass filtering
    - decimation
    - impulse-noise rejection (median-3)

## Update 2026-02-23
- Change: Split LIGHT activity headline into two-part human-movement wording in alert box.
  - for LIGHT stage, alert now renders two lines:
    - `HUMAN MOVEMENT`
    - `LIGHT ACTIVITY`
  - other stages continue using single-line headline labels
  - extended alert headline cache key size and logic to support two-line state redraw correctness

## Update 2026-02-23
- Change: Revised orientation UI per request:
  - removed the added left-segment gravity widget so the pump-text area remains in its prior layout.
  - replaced center arrow marker with a rolling ball inside the existing orientation circle.
  - rolling ball is accelerometer-driven (360-degree orientation mapping), light green in normal orientation, and light orange when upside down.
  - UI-only damping remains active for stable motion while leaving raw sensor/model data unchanged.

## Update 2026-02-23
- Change: Tuned rolling-ball orientation behavior for requested kinematics:
  - reduced damping and increased per-frame angle step limit so motion responds faster.
  - changed ball radius from fixed-edge to tilt-proportional (`sqrt(X^2+Y^2)/|g|`), so:
    - table-flat posture drives ball toward center,
    - larger tilt drives ball outward toward the circle edge.
  - preserved screen-facing posture direction mapping (ball moves toward bottom when held parallel to eyes).

## Update 2026-02-23
- Change: Fixed intermittent `mg/dL` disappearance and added spacing between anomaly rows:
  - narrowed left bargraph background-restore span from `BAR_X0 + 188` to `BAR_X0 + 170` so it no longer clips into the `mg/dL` text zone

## Update 2026-02-23
- Change: Recalibrated dosing so `ML/H` tracks motor `RPM` and `mA` behavior while preserving insulin pump math:
  - `RATE` now derived from instantaneous motor RPM (`ml/h = rpm * 0.002`), so idle motor shows `RATE:0.00 ML/H`
  - `mA` remains proportional to RPM via existing mapping, so dose/rpm/current now move together
  - basal target remains in `U/h` with `0.025 U/h` increments and uses U100 conversion (`100 U/mL`) for target volume pacing
  - pulse interval is now computed from delivered pulse volume and target `U/h`, so long-term reservoir depletion remains aligned with basal dosing profile

  - reason/detail text rewritten to activity codes (`ACT-L0..ACT-L4`) plus movement/vertical trend context
  - terminal status/system rows now report activity state and activity code instead of prior alert-reason strings

- Change: Implemented automatic transport-mode distinction to separate human effort from vehicle motion:
  - added auto classifier outputs: `FOOT`, `SKATE`, `SCOOT`, `BIKE`, `CAR`, `AIR`
  - classifier uses fused accel dynamics, gyro magnitude, and barometric pressure-rate trend
  - added transport confidence output (`gTransportConfidencePct`)
- Change: Human activity scoring is now transport-aware:
  - vehicle-like modes (`CAR`, `AIR`) downscale effort contribution to avoid vibration-driven false high activity
  - active personal mobility modes (`BIKE`, `SCOOT`, `SKATE`) apply lighter downscaling to preserve real rider effort
- Change: Terminal now shows auto transport context and confidence inline with activity (`TRN ... ACT ...`).
- Operation mode:
  - fully automatic by default; no user setting required for this behavior.

  - added guard for linear-accel streams that still include gravity
  - tightened rest clamp (`low accel + low gyro + low baro trend`) to suppress false motion
  - adjusted transport gating so very low-motion rest no longer auto-classifies as `CAR`

- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Moved center mg/dL + SIM lines upward to keep them fully outside the pump/elapsed clear bands; this isolates center text from y=240 region wipes.
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Enabled deterministic full-frame redraw compositing each refresh to eliminate section overdraw/dirty-region flicker; center CGM text remains final overlay.
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Reverted full-frame redraw mode due to whole-screen flashing and missing fields; restored incremental rendering while keeping center CGM text protections.

- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Isolated center mg/dL/SIM region from activity/ball renderer by adding a protected guard rectangle in orientation ring background restore and segment draw paths.
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Cleared residual ball/activity artifacts in center text zone by forcing per-frame background restore of the protected guard rectangle before overlay text redraw.
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Updated rendering strategy per request: ball/ring redraws normally, and center CGM text is re-drawn as final persistent overlay each frame with minimal dirty-clear only when text changes.
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Adopted permanent center-text overlay strategy: render ball/ring normally, then every frame restore a tight text-width background box and redraw mg/dL+SIM immediately (no broad clears, no guard carveouts).
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Replaced center text clear+draw flow with masked opaque glyph redraw (fg+bg per character cell) to avoid broad clears and reduce flicker/tearing.
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

- Change: Removed center-text background-cell rewrite path; mg/dL and SIM now render as transparent final overlay only to avoid black box and bargraph masking.
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Test mode: removed all center-text background restoration/masking; mg/dL and SIM are now pure transparent final overlays to isolate remaining 1 Hz flicker source.
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Removed activity bargraph/orientation ring draw from the runtime frame path for test isolation.
  - disabled activity renderer invocation in `GaugeRender_DrawFrame()`
  - retained renderer function source but marked `DrawHumanOrientationPointer()` as intentionally unused for clean `-Werror` builds
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Restored activity ball/orientation ring rendering in runtime frame path.

  - removed temporary test-disable block that suppressed `ball_x/ball_y/ball_color`
  - ball now draws as a filled marker with outline + highlight on top of the activity arc
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Stabilized MG/DL + SIM rendering with activity ball/bargraph active.
  - `DrawGlucoseIndicator()` now restores only a tight background band behind center text before redraw (prevents text smearing)
  - `DrawHumanOrientationPointer()` now skips arc segments and ball draw that intersect the center text guard zone (prevents overdraw/flicker in text rows)
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Adjusted center-text/ball interaction to address disappearing ball and persistent flashing.
  - removed orientation-layer center guard clipping so ball never disappears when crossing text region
  - changed `DrawGlucoseIndicator()` band clear policy to clear only when displayed values change (still redraws text each frame)
  - outcome goal: no text smear on value updates and reduced frame-to-frame flash in center text rows
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Switched elapsed runtime clock source to MCU hardware RTC (IRTC).
  - added `fsl_irtc` driver integration to project build
  - initialized IRTC at boot and captured RTC epoch on each elapsed-clock reset event
  - runtime elapsed display now computes `elapsed_sec` from RTC wall-time delta; timebase path remains fallback if RTC read fails
  - retained existing UI reset semantics for playback/record transitions
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Rolled back the recent MCU IRTC integration due to boot freeze and restored prior runtime/elapsed clock implementation.

  - restored `sdk_example/mcuxsdk_examples_overlay/demo_apps/edgeai_medical_device_demo/CMakeLists.txt` to HEAD baseline (removed explicit IRTC driver add)
  - this returns elapsed/logging flow to the previous known-good logic path
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Restored the previously working counter-read elapsed-time path (for runtime clock + logging cohesion).
  - reintroduced OSTIMER source calibration against delay window for both raw and decoded counters
  - runtime now selects the closer source (`OSTIMER_GetCurrentTimerRawValue` vs `OSTIMER_GetCurrentTimerValue`) and uses matched `s_timebase_hz`
  - no MCU IRTC integration in this change; existing runtime/logging architecture preserved
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Prevented elapsed clock display from counting up/down due small timing jitter.
  - added bounded anti-backstep guard (<=3 s) in normal, record, and playback display update paths
  - keeps existing mode-reset behavior intact (`runtime_displayed_sec = UINT32_MAX` still allows intentional resets)
- Command: ./scripts/build_and_flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24

- Change: Restored runtime behavior path where center `mg/dL` + `SIM` lines are present while activity ball/bargraph are active by rebuilding/flashing from current source (not a saved restore artifact).
  - note: the exact historical point before ball-removal tests was a runtime iteration and was not captured as a standalone failsafe/golden `.bin`.
  - command: `./scripts/build_and_flash.sh`
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed elapsed-time counter stability in runtime, record, and playback clock paths.

    - keeps runtime monotonic decisecond tracking internally but avoids unstable frequency selection that can skew elapsed time
- Verification:
  - `./tools/build_frdmmcxn947.sh debug` PASS
  - `./tools/flash_frdmmcxn947.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

- Change: Corrected elapsed-time rate by removing delay-based calibration from runtime time conversion.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - runtime `s_timebase_hz` now uses nominal 32.768 kHz unless `CLOCK_GetOstimerClkFreq()` is tightly within expected range (30.72k..34.816k)

  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`:
    - set `s_timebase_use_raw = false`
    - runtime `s_timebase_hz` now prefers measured decimal counter rate (`dec_meas`) within `[4096..65536]`, else bounded config/nominal fallback

    - mode-row option text changed from `ADAPT`/`TRAINED` to `OFF`/`ON`
    - selection state bound to `ai_enabled` state (`gPrevAiEnabled`)
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - mode-row touch handler now toggles `ai_enabled` OFF/ON and calls `PowerData_SetAiAssistEnabled(...)`
    - UART log updated for this row to `AI_ENABLE,OFF|ON`
- Note: Existing `MCU/NPU` settings row was intentionally kept as requested.
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Flashed latest debug build after Settings update (`MODE` row -> `AI OFF/ON`, `MCU/NPU` retained).
  - command: `./scripts/flash.sh`
  - runner: `linkserver`
  - target detected: `MCXN947:FRDM-MCXN947`
  - probe: `#1 UYLKOJI11H2B3`
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed AI toggle behavior and alert-panel UX issues.
  - `src/gauge_render.c`
    - added runtime AI enable gate (`gUiAiEnabled`) so prediction alert logic is disabled when AI is OFF
    - `DrawAiAlertOverlay(...)` now shows `AI OFF` state when disabled instead of continuing alert severity flow
    - added prediction accuracy scoreboard line below activity/warning box: `PRED SCORE xx%`
      - score is computed from delayed 15m/30m prediction error tracking using ring-buffered due-evaluation
    - updated AI pill styling so both `AI MCU` and `AI NPU` render as green banners
  - retained settings behavior from prior update:
    - mode-row (`AI OFF/ON`) toggles AI enable state
    - existing `MCU/NPU` row remains present
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed AI control semantics and banner coloring to match runtime intent.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - `AI OFF/ON` row remains the sole AI enable switch (`ai_enabled` + `PowerData_SetAiAssistEnabled`)
    - `MCU/NPU` row no longer toggles AI enable; it now selects backend label only
  - `src/gauge_render.h`
    - added `GaugeRender_SetAiBackendNpu(bool use_npu)`
  - `src/gauge_render.c`
    - added independent backend state tracking for `MCU/NPU` selection (`gUiAiBackendNpu`)
    - top AI pill label now follows backend selection (`AI MCU` / `AI NPU`)
    - top AI pill color now follows enable state:
      - AI ON -> green
      - AI OFF -> dark background
    - settings `MCU/NPU` selection highlight now follows backend selection (independent of enable)
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Added boot/warmup `THINKING` status in the warning/activity box.
  - `src/gauge_render.c`
    - `DrawAiAlertOverlay(...)` now renders `THINKING` (yellow) while prediction score is not yet primed (`!gUiPredMaePrimed`), provided AI is enabled and not in record/training overlays
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Corrected prediction-score priming so startup no longer reports synthetic baseline (~67%) as a real accuracy value.
  - `src/gauge_render.c`
    - added `gUiPredEvalCount` and increment on each consumed due-time prediction evaluation
    - score priming now requires at least 6 consumed evaluations (`gUiPredEvalCount >= 6`)
    - reset prediction-eval/priming/score state at CGM preprocess initialization
- Effect:
  - warning box stays `THINKING` until real 15m/30m evaluations have actually completed
  - score transitions from thinking state only after enough real evidence exists
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed playback runtime clock freeze at replay-loop boundary.
  - Root cause: playback timestamp monotonic clamp prevented `ts_ds` from decreasing when replay restarted, so display clock stuck at last sample time (e.g., `07:47`).
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - on successful `ExtFlashRecorder_StartPlayback()` in loop-restart path, reset clock state:
      - `runtime_displayed_ds = UINT32_MAX`
      - `GaugeRender_SetRuntimeClock(0u, 0u, 0u, 0u, true)`
- Effect:
  - playback/live-loop clock now resets and advances again each replay cycle instead of freezing at end-of-trace.
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Reset `docs/TODO.md` to a new roadmap and cleared prior completed checklist from active TODO view.
  - new TODO now focuses on next-phase realism/validation items:
    - true timestamp-driven live replay
    - startup warm-up/preseed and readiness UX
    - pump/motor realism and safety interlocks
    - outcome metrics and release/restore steps
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Fixed warmup score timeline: prediction accuracy now advances on per-sample decisecond timeline during catch-up to prevent stuck 0% after primer.
- Binary: mcuxsdk_ws/build/edgeai_medical_device_demo_cm33_core0.bin
- Command: ./scripts/build.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Prediction score now uses per-prediction evaluation with ±1% tolerance hit tracking plus MAE blend; score priming starts after first matured prediction (no 6-sample gate).
- Binary: mcuxsdk_ws/build/edgeai_medical_device_demo_cm33_core0.bin
- Command: ./scripts/build.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Score strip now shows evaluation count (E#) and no longer hides score behind primed gate after evaluations start; aids runtime diagnosis of 0% issues.
- Binary: mcuxsdk_ws/build/edgeai_medical_device_demo_cm33_core0.bin
- Command: ./scripts/build.sh
- Result: ok

- Command: ./scripts/build.sh && ./scripts/flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Diagnostic scoring now uses pure tolerance-hit rate (no MAE blend) to verify score pipeline behavior; rebuilt and flashed.
- Binary: mcuxsdk_ws/build/edgeai_medical_device_demo_cm33_core0.bin
- Command: ./scripts/build.sh && ./scripts/flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Applied user-selected scoring profile items 1+2: tolerance set to ±10% and evaluation counter E# retained in score strip; rebuilt and flashed.

- Command: ./scripts/build.sh && ./scripts/flash.sh
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Documentation refresh: synchronized TODO, runtime contract, traceability, and validation docs with current prediction-score/E#/MAE behavior and latest baseline findings.
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Wired exported trained CGM model into MCXN947 firmware prediction path.
  - `src/cgm_preprocess.c`
    - embedded ridge model coefficients from project `model/cgm_best_model.cpp`
    - added feature builder for trained contract fields (`lag1/2/3`, deltas, accel, rolling means)
    - replaced placeholder linear-only predictor with trained + conservative linear blend
    - retained SQI/sensor-flag confidence derating and mg/dL clamps (`40..400`)
- Effect:
  - `CgmModel_Predict()` now uses trained model behavior for `+15m` with bounded extrapolation used for `+30m`.
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - output: `mcuxsdk_ws/build/edgeai_medical_device_demo_cm33_core0.bin`
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Flashed MCXN947 with trained-CGM-integrated firmware build.
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
  - runner: `west flash` with `linkserver` (probe `#1`, FRDM-MCXN947)
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Updated LIVE replay flow to run benchmark-style through dataset and hold final prediction score.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - added `RECPLAY_FULLRUN_MULTIPLIER` for post-warmup fast replay stepping
    - warmup remains first 4 hours (`RECPLAY_WARMUP_TARGET_DS` unchanged)
    - after warmup, replay continues accelerated through full dataset (no realtime cadence handoff)
    - on end-of-dataset in LIVE mode:
      - stop playback (no loop restart)
      - mark run complete and hold state
      - force playhead to 100%
      - keep final `PRED SCORE`/`MAE` visible on dashboard
    - runtime clock progression now freezes when benchmark run is complete (`playback_run_complete` guard)
    - restart paths reset completion flag so user can rerun benchmark via mode/timeline interactions
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Prevented post-benchmark auto-restart that could reset/overwrite final score display.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - guarded `AI_TRAIN: complete_live` auto-promote playback restart with `!playback_run_complete`
- Effect:
  - after full-run completion in LIVE benchmark mode, firmware no longer re-enters playback via trained-ready auto transition
  - final timeline/score hold behavior remains latched until explicit user restart action
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Addressed `E9818` with `0%` prediction score by fixing trained feature mapping and completion restart path.
  - `src/cgm_preprocess.c`
    - set trained `epoch_s` feature to model mean (instead of runtime-relative epoch counter) to prevent large standardized bias and clipped predictions.
  - `src/edgeai_medical_device_demo.c`
    - blocked trained-ready auto-promote playback restart when benchmark run is already complete (`!playback_run_complete` guard).
- Rationale:
  - `E9818` confirms scoring path is active; persistent `0%` indicated systematic prediction mismatch, not missing evaluator wiring.
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok

## Update 2026-02-24
- Change: Replaced CGM predictor with glucose-only trained model (removed unconnected insulin/motor feature dependency).
  - Training dataset: `data/d1namo_train_excl001.csv`
  - Holdout dataset: `data/d1namo_test_subject001.csv`
  - Output metrics artifact: `model/cgm_glucose_only_metrics.json`
  - Feature set (9):

    - `glucose_mgdl_lag1`
    - `glucose_mgdl_lag2`
    - `glucose_mgdl_lag3`
    - `glucose_delta1`
    - `glucose_delta2`
    - `glucose_accel`
    - `glucose_roll3`

  - MAE `7.4848`
  - RMSE `10.4997`
  - R2 `0.98567`
  - tol10 hit rate `0.84181`
- Firmware integration:
  - `src/cgm_preprocess.c` embedded model coefficients/normalization updated to 9-feature glucose-only contract.
- Verification:
  - `./scripts/build.sh` PASS
  - `./scripts/flash.sh` PASS
- Result: ok
